# Case Study Integrating-Apps

In this case study we are integrating an app store into a custom operating system we are designing. We can choose to integrate the Apple Store or Google Play, but not both. We want to use the platform that sells the best quality apps. We decide to use the app ratings as a quality metric and gather some data about rating from the two stores. 

In this case study, We analyze whether there is a significant difference between the ratings on these two platforms that would justify choosing one over the other. If there's not, we can always just flip a coin to pick which platform to use at random.
